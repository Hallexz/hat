moscow file pavel pavel fedotov ex google tech lead i reviewed hundreds of engineering resumes here a recap on some of my best tips below more interview training with ex google and ex facebook engineers at the second rule take seconds to scan your resume from the beginning reading through it quickly as if you had a dozen other resumes to get through this may involve reading only the first half page scanning the first words of each sentence bullet point what do you see if it all over the place with fluff words weak verbs and shows weakness chances are your resume will get thrown out because seconds is probably about as much time as a recruiter hiring manager is going to give you here what you need to ensure the first words at the top of your resume should be very software developer oriented around developing implementing creating and building developed a rest api in x using python and java built a full stack web app and launched to users taught myself golang and implemented a framework for a webserver that starting to sound like a candidate we might be interested in the resume should flow in sentence structure explaining one after another in active verbs what you have personally done there a rhythm here built x created y developed z implemented a built if you are breaking up the resume with statements rather than actions like a project to terraform the geoclusters that halts the readability of the resume with fluff words that explain absolutely nothing and switching the subject between you your project your team and your company causes mental breaks the subject should be you it should be clear that you are a strong developer for the targeted role within the first few moments of reading your resume if it is not strong you need to rephrase your resume pitfalls do use non engineering words like documented supported troubleshooted automated unit testing etc you are not applying to be tech support here or a documentation writer so there no need to highlight those points just like how you would highlight that you can cook even though the company may need a few good cooks that not what you expecting to do here at the top do list low priority information like hobbies extracurriculars or irrelevant skills like photoshop premiere excel move these towards the bottom of the resume or just leave out skills that may dilute your resume do spend too much time explaining what the company does or what the team does explain what you personally did tell a story descriptions should tell a story it is absolutely useless to list a bunch of technical jargon that no one knows imagine reading a laundry list of implemented x version implemented y in sprintspark implemented z using it just does matter what someone implemented if there is no story behind it even worse many people do explain the languages used and these technologies are often all proprietary so there is no way to reuse the skillset saying that you implemented carraform and launched to prexo springsuite is like saying nothing and yet most resumes are absolutely littered with phrases like this i would recommend you explain your descriptions in a format of accomplishment impact challenge this components tell a complete story for instance you might say developed a server side layout engine in ios by teaching myself golang to automate antiquated manual layouts working with a coworker this began as an ambiguous project that i drove to completion and launched company wide this is far more impactful and relatable since it explains what you did why it was hard and what the validation of that work was less is more focus on a few very strong points and develop those instead of a long list of bullet point features none of which seem very interesting for anyone to care about if you have a big accomplishment spend more time on your resume to talk about that the fact is that any bullet point could have an amazing story behind it but you need to reveal that story i once saw a resume with a co founder role and yet there was a single word bullet point co founded a company and launched that looks disgenuine was this real what were the challenges and impact is this worth talking about obviously not if the candidate did have much to say about it it about you not about your accomplishment what many candidates fail to realize is that i want to know what you as an individual did not what your company did not what your team did not what your project did what you did because the fact is the only thing you able to bring to my team is you so i want to know about your personal contributions to a project that it what type of character are you what skills do you have how did you apply those skills what motivates you it does matter if your company is the worldclass leader in enterprise solutions with clients if the only task you did was write tooling documentation so do worry so much about listing every little accomplishment like how you implemented terraform in carbos using carabide nothing in that sentence is usable or translatable but if you were to say taught myself carabide in months and collaborated with teams to lead development of terraform launching with carbos that tells me a lot more about your ability to learn your collaboration skills and your passion for creating show do tell every bad resume seems to have a portion where the candidate will say i am hardworking enthusiastic and passionate i am a great communicator have excellent teamwork skills and am perfect you telling me but you not showing me what reason do i have to believe you if you such a great communicator you should have the stories to back that up instead of telling me that you can communicate show me that through a story about how you mentored your team through weekly presentations leading to the adoption of the viewmodel pattern in the codebase if you passionate tell me about a pet project you started if you hardworking tell me about how you taught yourself a new language and shipped it under a tight deadline the resume is where these stories paint a picture of you it is your personal marketing brochure not a fact sheet what in here is bs a trained resume reviewer will be scanning for fake bs stories for a resume to standout it needs to contain validation you validate your skills by explaining the results the impacts of your work some tips here for each story list the impact instead of saying implemented x say implemented x and was featured in the techcrunch or this work was adopted to the wider team or saving xx thousands of dollars or and sped up developer velocity i seen resumes with pet projects and yet not a single link to the project website or github or anything where the evidence of any of this were these worthless projects that were trashed put in concrete technical details where they count to substantiate your claims if you have a one liner developed the iphone that just not believable but if you can expand on that with all the relevant technologies challenges that makes your claim believable grounding the claim in reality makes it impressive people wo click on your links a lot of candidates put links in their resume which is great but just know that of people will not be going through the hassle of opening each and every link i seen a number of resumes where people say built project maven the description here is sufficient and it needs to stand on its own you ca assume anyone will go to these links if you have links it may help to have a single personal page rather than a dozen links to your github linkedin facebook twitter personal page project project etc who going to open all of that make the links easy to type using a shortener or custom domain if someone takes the time to open any of these make sure the projects look good if i waste minutes of my time to check out your personal github and it just scrap waste projects guess where your resume going too target your resume to the role a lot of candidates get confused about facts vs story your resume is not a fact sheet it is a targeted story subjectively told in an effort to persuade a biased decision if you worked in a hardware engineer role and now you want to do software engineering do you talk about your hardware work if you can cook do you talk about that if you worked as an uber driver do you list that the answer to all of these is no depending on the role at hand you want to highlight just the relevant skills even if at your last job of the work was python if you applying for a python role you want to be gushing about all the python development that you did implemented x in python used python to do taught myself python frameworks django and flask to do if the role is for machine learning focus in on those keywords if it for a web frontend engineer focus in on your web javascript skills if you aim for everything you hit nothing you must code the hilarious thing is sometimes people apply for swe roles and yet they do seem to want to actually code they go into the interviews and say i do code anymore i more into strategy i lead projects i managed my team and coordinated them i a co founder and ceo i an entrepreneur i have leadership skills i a great communicator and team player i once saw a resume where the top experiences were co founder co founder cto ok maybe you should go apply to be a cofounder then because this role is for coder too many people do want to code or think they above the code many resumes i read seem reluctant to mention code or languages people might say created x y and z and shipped this project leading and coordinating development on well where in this sentence did you actually do coding let put it this way if you applied for a swe role you expected to code not to waltz around the office in a suit going to meetings with the vp of sales so show the languages frameworks and technologies that you using a lot of people will bucket all of that into the bottom of their resume under skills c python javascript and never mention any of these again in the rest of their resume that is simply not very convincing evidence that you can actually code it does explain how well you can code formatting let talk about formatting it matters single page if you are using more than a single page you are rambling trim it down because no one has time to read all of this stuff highlight just your best most recent work like a brochure single column double column layouts and fancy fonts graphics generally just distract and people can accidentally skip portions of your resume it does flow fully spell the names of companies which looks better vmware or vmware the mental weight of the fully spelled name makes it look more official and professional fully spell the names of your degree education similarly do short change your year degree if you have one by saying majored in cs at ohio state make it look good bachelor of science in computer science ohio state gpa that better it may even be appropriate here to list additonal activities honor societies relevant coursework projects to bulk up the education a little more so that it not just a one liner grammar check spelling check capitalization check no photos in the us it is illegal to discriminate based on age gender race or appearance do put photos on your resume for that purpose your name i been toying with this idea recently but it something to think about let pretend you have a name like xheycho yining sundarabai xylophone i sure it a beautiful name in your language but it does look familiar for many people i seen some colleagues with unpronounceable names and they say just call me bobby or just call me shay and that instantly seems to make them more relatable think about it your name is your personal brand and is to be memorable it paints a picture about the person behind the resume it may help to put something like shay xheycho yining sundarabai xylophone up to you though this is just a theory age age discrimination is absolutely illegal if age is a concern for you consider removing your graduation dates no one will ask you to list those because it is illegal the objective not everyone needs an objective but if you have a broad background an objective may help focus your resume and clarify your intentions especially if you switching fields people may get thrown off an objective is a quick way to briefly explain what going on here instead of allowing a person to read the resume once become confused at your history then read it again then think about the open roles then try to figure out if there any mistake here etc oftentimes i see a candidate resume and it all over the place there a little of everything so i ask myself first of all what type of role is this person going for ios android backend frontend machine learning graphics are they even interested in graphics this is one reason you need to focus your resume as mentioned above an objective is a tool for helping you do that if you feel your background is wandering all over the place last impressions count every resume has a first impression and every resume leaves a last impression this is the last thing on there make it look good and make it count i seen some resumes that just end with something forgettable like education bs in biology at canvers institute does that look good to you bleh i think even if you were to list a few fun facts about you as a person like a cool hobby a cool project or next to your education list some neat clubs activities coursework you did that can make your resume more memorable make yourself seem like someone people want to bring in to personally meet ready to fast track your career in tech visit and join our community file pavel pavel orlov senior

individually attending healthy lifestyle studying two foreign languages english and german ivan ivan petrov ex google tech lead i reviewed hundreds of engineering resumes here a recap on some of my best tips below more interview training with ex google and ex facebook engineers at the second rule take seconds to scan your resume from the beginning reading through it quickly as if you had a dozen other resumes to get through this may involve reading only the first half page scanning the first words of each sentence bullet point what do you see if it all over the place with fluff words weak verbs and shows weakness chances are your resume will get thrown out because seconds is probably about as much time as a recruiter hiring manager is going to give you here what you need to ensure the first words at the top of your resume should be very software developer oriented around developing implementing creating and building developed a rest api in x using python and java built a full stack web app and launched to users taught myself golang and implemented a framework for a webserver that starting to sound like a candidate we might be interested in the resume should flow in sentence structure explaining one after another in active verbs what you have personally done there a rhythm here built x created y developed z implemented a built if you are breaking up the resume with statements rather than actions like a project to terraform the geoclusters that halts the readability of the resume with fluff words that explain absolutely nothing and switching the subject between you your project your team and your company causes mental breaks the subject should be you it should be clear that you are a strong developer for the targeted role within the first few moments of reading your resume if it is not strong you need to rephrase your resume pitfalls do use non engineering words like documented supported troubleshooted automated unit testing etc you are not applying to be tech support here or a documentation writer so there no need to highlight those points just like how you would highlight that you can cook even though the company may need a few good cooks that not what you expecting to do here at the top do list low priority information like hobbies extracurriculars or irrelevant skills like photoshop premiere excel move these towards the bottom of the resume or just leave out skills that may dilute your resume do spend too much time explaining what the company does or what the team does explain what you personally did tell a story descriptions should tell a story it is absolutely useless to list a bunch of technical jargon that no one knows imagine reading a laundry list of implemented x version implemented y in sprintspark implemented z using it just does matter what someone implemented if there is no story behind it even worse many people do explain the languages used and these technologies are often all proprietary so there is no way to reuse the skillset saying that you implemented carraform and launched to prexo springsuite is like saying nothing and yet most resumes are absolutely littered with phrases like this i would recommend you explain your descriptions in a format of accomplishment impact challenge this components tell a complete story for instance you might say developed a server side layout engine in ios by teaching myself golang to automate antiquated manual layouts working with a coworker this began as an ambiguous project that i drove to completion and launched company wide this is far more impactful and relatable since it explains what you did why it was hard and what the validation of that work was less is more focus on a few very strong points and develop those instead of a long list of bullet point features none of which seem very interesting for anyone to care about if you have a big accomplishment spend more time on your resume to talk about that the fact is that any bullet point could have an amazing story behind it but you need to reveal that story i once saw a resume with a co founder role and yet there was a single word bullet point co founded a company and launched that looks disgenuine was this real what were the challenges and impact is this worth talking about obviously not if the candidate did have much to say about it it about you not about your accomplishment what many candidates fail to realize is that i want to know what you as an individual did not what your company did not what your team did not what your project did what you did because the fact is the only thing you able to bring to my team is you so i want to know about your personal contributions to a project that it what type of character are you what skills do you have how did you apply those skills what motivates you it does matter if your company is the worldclass leader in enterprise solutions with clients if the only task you did was write tooling documentation so do worry so much about listing every little accomplishment like how you implemented terraform in carbos using carabide nothing in that sentence is usable or translatable but if you were to say taught myself carabide in months and collaborated with teams to lead development of terraform launching with carbos that tells me a lot more about your ability to learn your collaboration skills and your passion for creating show do tell every bad resume seems to have a portion where the candidate will say i am hardworking enthusiastic and passionate i am a great communicator have excellent teamwork skills and am perfect you telling me but you not showing me what reason do i have to believe you if you such a great communicator you should have the stories to back that up instead of telling me that you can communicate show me that through a story about how you mentored your team through weekly presentations leading to the adoption of the viewmodel pattern in the codebase if you passionate tell me about a pet project you started if you hardworking tell me about how you taught yourself a new language and shipped it under a tight deadline the resume is where these stories paint a picture of you it is your personal marketing brochure not a fact sheet what in here is bs a trained resume reviewer will be scanning for fake bs stories for a resume to standout it needs to contain validation you validate your skills by explaining the results the impacts of your work some tips here for each story list the impact instead of saying implemented x say implemented x and was featured in the techcrunch or this work was adopted to the wider team or saving xx thousands of dollars or and sped up developer velocity i seen resumes with pet projects and yet not a single link to the project website or github or anything where the evidence of any of this were these worthless projects that were trashed put in concrete technical details where they count to substantiate your claims if you have a one liner developed the iphone that just not believable but if you can expand on that with all the relevant technologies challenges that makes your claim believable grounding the claim in reality makes it impressive people wo click on your links a lot of candidates put links in their resume which is great but just know that of people will not be going through the hassle of opening each and every link i seen a number of resumes where people say built project maven the description here is sufficient and it needs to stand on its own you ca assume anyone will go to these links if you have links it may help to have a single personal page rather than a dozen links to your github linkedin facebook twitter personal page project project etc who going to open all of that make the links easy to type using a shortener or custom domain if someone takes the time to open any of these make sure the projects look good if i waste minutes of my time to check out your personal github and it just scrap waste projects guess where your resume going too target your resume to the role a lot of candidates get confused about facts vs story your resume is not a fact sheet it is a targeted story subjectively told in an effort to persuade a biased decision if you worked in a hardware engineer role and now you want to do software engineering do you talk about your hardware work if you can cook do you talk about that if you worked as an uber driver do you list that the answer to all of these is no depending on the role at hand you want to highlight just the relevant skills even if at your last job of the work was python if you applying for a python role you want to be gushing about all the python development that you did implemented x in python used python to do taught myself python frameworks django and flask to do if the role is for machine learning focus in on those keywords if it for a web frontend engineer focus in on your web javascript skills if you aim for everything you hit nothing you must code the hilarious thing is sometimes people apply for swe roles and yet they do seem to want to actually code they go into the interviews and say i do code anymore i more into strategy i lead projects i managed my team and coordinated them i a co founder and ceo i an entrepreneur i have leadership skills i a great communicator and team player i once saw a resume where the top experiences were co founder co founder cto ok maybe you should go apply to be a cofounder then because this role is for coder too many people do want to code or think they above the code many resumes i read seem reluctant to mention code or languages people might say created x y and z and shipped this project leading and coordinating development on well where in this sentence did you actually do coding let put it this way if you applied for a swe role you expected to code not to waltz around the office in a suit going to meetings with the vp of sales so show the languages frameworks and technologies that you using a lot of people will bucket all of that into the bottom of their resume under skills c python javascript and never mention any of these again in the rest of their resume that is simply not very convincing evidence that you can actually code it does explain how well you can code formatting let talk about formatting it matters single page if you are using more than a single page you are rambling trim it down because no one has time to read all of this stuff highlight just your best most recent work like a brochure single column double column layouts and fancy fonts graphics generally just distract and people can accidentally skip portions of your resume it does flow fully spell the names of companies which looks better vmware or vmware the mental weight of the fully spelled name makes it look more official and professional fully spell the names of your degree education similarly do short change your year degree if you have one by saying majored in cs at ohio state make it look good bachelor of science in computer science ohio state gpa that better it may even be appropriate here to list additonal activities honor societies relevant coursework projects to bulk up the education a little more so that it not just a one liner grammar check spelling check capitalization check no photos in the us it is illegal to discriminate based on age gender race or appearance do put photos on your resume for that purpose your name i been toying with this idea recently but it something to think about let pretend you have a name like xheycho yining sundarabai xylophone i sure it a beautiful name in your language but it does look familiar for many people i seen some colleagues with unpronounceable names and they say just call me bobby or just call me shay and that instantly seems to make them more relatable think about it your name is your personal brand and is to be memorable it paints a picture about the person behind the resume it may help to put something like shay xheycho yining sundarabai xylophone up to you though this is just a theory age age discrimination is absolutely illegal if age is a concern for you consider removing your graduation dates no one will ask you to list those because it is illegal the objective not everyone needs an objective but if you have a broad background an objective may help focus your resume and clarify your intentions especially if you switching fields people may get thrown off an objective is a quick way to briefly explain what going on here instead of allowing a person to read the resume once become confused at your history then read it again then think about the open roles then try to figure out if there any mistake here etc oftentimes i see a candidate resume and it all over the place there a little of everything so i ask myself first of all what type of role is this person going for ios android backend frontend machine learning graphics are they even interested in graphics this is one reason you need to focus your resume as mentioned above an objective is a tool for helping you do that if you feel your background is wandering all over the place last impressions count every resume has a first impression and every resume leaves a last impression this is the last thing on there make it look good and make it count i seen some resumes that just end with something forgettable like education bs in biology at canvers institute does that look good to you bleh i think even if you were to list a few fun facts about you as a person like a cool hobby a cool project or next to your education list some neat clubs activities coursework you did that can make your resume more memorable make yourself seem like someone people want to bring in to personally meet ivan
